## Introduction
I choose to make portfolio because I thought it was a project that wouldn't be big enough and at the same time I would learn a lot in the progress. The purpose of is to shown who i'm, what i do and how to get in contact with me.

### Method
I started this project with making a trelloboard, on the board i listed everything needed on the site and what i needed to think about.

### Project goals
The goal is to make a functioning website that will represent who I'm, my interests and how to get in contact with me.   

### Tools
The IDE I will be using is Atom.

I will be using html, css and jquery for the frontend and a little bit of nodejs for the backend

### Evaluation of work and product
I learn a lot during the making of this website, especially how to use flexbox and a bit nodejs. Want I wanted to have but didn't have time to implement was an email form, my plan is to get this to work later on.
