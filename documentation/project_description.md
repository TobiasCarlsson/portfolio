## Introduction
I choose to make portfolio because I thought it was a project that wouldn't be big enough and at the same time I would learn a lot in the progress. The purpose of is to shown who i'm, what i do and how to get in contact with me.

### Method
I started this project with making a trelloboard, on the board i listed everything needed on the site and what i needed to think about.

### Project goals
The goal is to make a functioning website that will show who I'm and what I do.

### Tools
The tools I will be using for this website is the text editor atom which can handle any type of text and code.

I will use jquery and bootsrap to make it easier for myself
